	<p>Bohol is a Philippine province located in the Central Visayas region. It is made up of Bohol Island and a number of smaller surrounding islands. Bohol is famous for its coral reefs and unusual geological formations, particularly the Chocolate Hills. These 1,200 or so symmetrical mounds on the main island, near the town of Carmen, turn cocoa-brown in the dry season, contrasting with the greenery of the surrounding jungle.</p>
	<p>Bohol will always hold a soecial spot in my heart, not only because of it's beauty but for the people that are in it as well. And one of those people is my lola, whose very dear to me. I remember always being so excited to visit the province to see my lola and to once again view the beauty of its suroundings. Fun fact, I've been to Bohol multiple times now, yet I still haven't visited the Chocolate Hills. Though, I sure do hope that I get to visit Bohol again this year, and visit it and of course try new activities as well.</p>
	<p>What to do in Bohol: Visit the ever so iconic Chocolate Hills, Lounge at it's beaches, Tour around the towns (Panglao, Jagna, Tagbilaran, etc.), Island hoping and view it's marine life, Boat ride, Cruise, Fishing, Try out the cuisines, See one of the smallest primates - the Tarsiers, and more.  </p>
